    "The complexity class for classical integer factoring is believed to be between P and NP-hard.  Although research has yielded algorithms that perform faster than the intuitive trial division, including Fermat's algorithm, Pollard's two algorithms, and sieve algorithms, it's still an open question whether a classical algorithm exists that can factor in polynomial time. For quantum computing, Shor's algorithm runs in polynomial time (the D-Wave system does not run this algorithm).  \n",

    "This notebook solves factoring on a D-Wave quantum computer by formulating it as a *constraint satisfaction problem*. CSPs require that all a problem's variables be assigned values that result in the satisfying of all constraints. For factoring, the problem's constraints are that the two variables representing factors, $a$ and $b$, be assigned only natural numbers and that their multiplication be equal to the factored number, $P$. \n",

The job-shop scheduling problem is to schedule multiple jobs done on several machines with constraints on the machines' execution of tasks. You can apply the solution technique shown here to many CSPs. "

    "\n",
    "D-Wave systems solve binary quadratic models (BQM), the Ising model traditionally used in statistical mechanics and its computer-science equivalent, the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Given $N$ variables $x_1,...,x_N$, where each variable $x_i$ can have binary values $0$ or $1$, the system finds assignments of values that minimize\n",

    "\n",
    "There are different ways to formulate the factoring problem as a BQM. Let's start with an intuitive one. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulation A\n",
    "Feel comfortable skipping this subsection if you prefer to move on to what we'll be coding. Or try implementing it yourself as an exercise, although this is not our recommended formulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can solve an equation, say $x+1=2$, by minimizing the square of the subtraction of one side from another, $\\min_x[2-(x+1)]^2$. Intuitively such a minimization seeks the shortest distance between the sides, which occurs at equality, with the square eliminating negative distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a factored number, $P$, to be equal to its factors, $a, b$, you can solve  $P=ab$ with the minimization\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min_{a,b}(P-ab)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this minimization on a quantum computer, we would represent the integers with equivalent binary numbers; for example, integer $a$ is represented as $a_0 + 2a_1 + 4a_2 +... +2^ma_m$, where variables $a_i$ can have binary values $0$ or $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The D-Wave system solves binary *quadratic* models so our now-binary minimization should not have terms with higher order than $a_ib_j$. However, squaring $(P-ab)$ introduces non-quadratic terms for problems of any decent size. We would therefore use order reduction techniques on all higher terms. For example, by introducing a new variable $x_k=a_0b_2$, we can replace a non-quadratic term such as $8b_0b_2a_0^2$ with quadratic term $8b_0x_k$ (notice that $a_0^2=a_0$), and do so repeatedly until all terms are linear or quadratic. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would now have a BQM. Programming its coefficients on a D-Wave system would solve the factoring problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulation B\n",

    "This Jupyter Notebook showed how you can formulate a constraint satisfaction problem for solution on a quantum computer using Ocean software. We solved a factoring problem as an example of one proposed solution technique.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We considered two ways of formulating the factoring problem. Formulation A is intuitive and direct, but conversion of large integers to binary introduces (a) increasing weights per bit, $2^ma_m$, and (b) in the squaring of $(P-ab)$, terms of higher order that need to be reduced to quadratic. These affect performance. Formulation B, using binary gates, is a useful technique in general. The \"modularity\" of binary gates provides some benefits for minor-embedding: repeated small units that can be \"tiled\" onto the QPU's topology.       "
