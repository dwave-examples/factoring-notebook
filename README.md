# Factoring Jupyter Notebook

This notebook explains the quantum processing unit (QPU) programming model used
for factoring, and shows how to implement it using D-Wave Ocean's stack of
tools.

By the end of this notebook you will have seen how to convert a problem into
a binary quadratic model for submission to the D-Wave system and be able to modify
its parameters.
